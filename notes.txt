Currently I am working on:
- checkout forms and process
- products in stock and delivery time (additional features for product)
- search - which will display list of products
- newsletter - which will save subscription in admin panel
- fill contact data

I will let you know when this part of work is finished.
Then we will have to set it on target domain, add products and images for product categories, and connect to PayPal.
