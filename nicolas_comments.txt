Hi Nicolas,

1. 
To clarify Login (CONNEXION), User Area(MON COMPTE), Logout(DÃ‰CONNECTION) buttons.
- case 1: When user is not logged in we display Login and Register buttons.
- case 2: When user is logged in we display User Area (this is link to starting page) and Logout button.
Contact is displayed in both cases.
Login form is common for admin and user, so it is not good idea to have two links to the same page.

2. Second menu was created and it is visible when you login as administrator.
You market LES CONSULTATIONS EN COURS as drop-down menu - I think that it is better to keep it the same way like LA BOURSE (no menu here) - links are displayed anyway.
Drop down menu is used for MES INFORMATIONS - as this is not clickable itself (options of this item are - like change password).

3. I changed CMS Menu content and divided it on PUBLIC, SECURE and OTHERS area.

4. We have only one vote button and open question is not required. When results are displayed we show only poll.

5. We have images in slider on second and fifth position to show that it is possible (image size is 1140x360px). 

6. Links in footer was added as OTHER pages. Tags can be edited from admin panel as simple page. The code is as follows:
	<ul class="list-inline tagclouds">
		<li><a href="http://surveys.prothomsoft.com/surveys_page/vous-et-vos-experiences.html">CONFIANCE</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://surveys.prothomsoft.com/surveys_page/vous-et-vos-experiences.html">INVESTISSEMENTS</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://surveys.prothomsoft.com/surveys_page/vous-et-vos-experiences.html">PMI / ETI</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://surveys.prothomsoft.com/surveys_page/vous-et-vos-experiences.html">CCI</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://surveys.prothomsoft.com/surveys_page/vous-et-vos-experiences.html">CAC 40</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://surveys.prothomsoft.com/surveys_page/vous-et-vos-experiences.html">CICE</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://surveys.prothomsoft.com/surveys_page/vous-et-vos-experiences.html">INNOVATION</a></li>
	</ul>								

7. I removed slider from pages with form and user area.

8. User after login is directly redirected to LES CONSULTATIONS EN COURS

9. Change Password
