INSTALLATION

Mach-II for PHP uses either absolute or relative pathing for class
definition files, so installation of core framework files (the MachII
directory) and applications is very flexible.  The MachII directory
should be installed in your include_path, document root or any
subdirectory that contains an entry page (index.php).

There are two methods of installing Mach-II for PHP, the first is
automatic and makes use of the PEAR installer and the second is a
manual installation.  Both are described in detail.

***** PEAR Installer *****
The prefered method of installation is to use the PEAR installer.  It
has several advantages over a manual installation.  Installation can be
as simple as a single commandline.  It varifies that each file in the
package is uncorrupted, automatically places the core files in your include
path, validates dependencies (important for cache, filter and plugin
extensions), allows managing of packaged extensions and makes upgrading
very simple.

Note: PEAR installer requires PHP 4.2.0 or newer.

1) If PEAR is already installed and configured, skip to step 1b;
otherwise continue to step 1a.

1a) The installer has been included by default with PHP since 4.3.0 but
was not always usable with Windows "out of the box" until more recently.
Also, versions included with Linux distributions often are out of date.
If you need help installing PEAR see:
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php

1b) Unless you just installed PEAR, it is generally best to upgrade to the
latest beta version of the PEAR core:
pear config-set preferred_state beta
pear upgrade pear
pear config-set preferred_state {your preferred state, if other than beta}

2) There are two ways to install the Mach-II core, directly from the server
(step 2a) or from the package file (step 2b).

2a) At the command line:
pear config-set master_server php.mach-ii.com
pear install machii

If you won't be installing any more Mach-II packages for the time being
but will be using PEAR, restore the master_server setting to pear.php.net.
In the future PEAR will support multiple servers and it won't be necesary
to change it back and forth.

You're done!  Skip to step 4.

2b) Download the Mach-II core from it's package description page:
http://php.mach-ii.com/MachII

Or direct download the package at:
http://php.mach-ii.com/get/MachII

2c) At the command line:
pear install /path/to/MachII-x.x.x.tgz

You're done!  Continue to step 4.

4) Remember the -R or --installroot option can be used to override the
default install directory.  (Usually, /usr/share/pear or /usr/lib/php on
UNIX-like systems and C:\PHP\PEAR on Windows systems.)  If you set another
install directory, don't forget to add it to your PHP include_path.

You shouldn't need to check it but you should have a directory structure
like this:
path/
    to/
        pear/
            data/
                MachII/
                    data/
            docs/
                MachII/
                    docs/
            MachII/
                cache/
                filters/
                framework/
                locale/
                plugins/
                util/
                MachII.php
                mach-ii.php
            tests/
                MachII/
                    tests/

You are ready to test your install.


***** Manual Install *****
1) Download the Mach-II core from it's package description page:
http://php.mach-ii.com/MachII

Or direct download the package at:
http://php.mach-ii.com/get/MachII

2a) Create a directory called MachII in a directory that is in your PHP
include_path.  The MachII directory itself should NOT be in the
include_path definition.  For example, if the MachII directory is located
at /path/to/MachII, include_path should have an entry of /path/to.
 - or -
2b) Create a directory called MachII DIRECTLY under your web root. If your
webroot is "htdocs", your path would look like /path/to/htdocs/MachII.

3) Open the package, MachII-x.x.x.tgz, downloaded in step 1 and extract
contents of the MachII-x.x.x directory to the MachII directory created in
step 2.

You should have a directory structure like this:
path/
    to/
        MachII/
            cache/
            data/
            docs/
            filters/
            framework/
            locale/
            plugins/
            tests/
            util/
            MachII.php
            mach-ii.php

You are ready to test your install.


***** Testing *****
Requires compiled CLI version of PHP.

This will actually run a minimal Mach-II application to verify everything
is setup correctly.

1) Change to the tests/install directory.
2) Enter the following at the command prompt:
php -f test.php

If you received a success message you are ready to use Mach-II!

Otherwise, you might need...
