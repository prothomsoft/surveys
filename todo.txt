We take current date.

We go through all the users in the system in the loop which have DateMessageSent != CurrentDate.
For each user we get list of topics the user participated in.
Select nTopicId from TopicMessage where nUserId = 3;

In this point we have current date, userId, and list of topic Ids he participated in.

We look for all the messages from day before current date for topics user participated and his Id:
select count(*) from TopicMessage where Date = (current date - 1 day) and topicId in (list) and UserId = 3;

If number from this query is equal 0 it means that there are new messages. 
Why because there is a number of messages in some topics and this day user was not part of conversation.
Hence we send email in this case.

As we do not have cron jobs then we have to run this procedure when any user is logged in and alse we need to mark that message was sent this day.
When message is sent we place current date in User table DateMessageSent.
